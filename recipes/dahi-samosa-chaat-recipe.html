        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Knead the dough and let it rest for 15-20 minutes</strong></li>
                <p>
                    To prepare this sumptuous chaat recipe, mix together all purpose flour, salt, butter and carom seeds with a little water to make a 
                    smooth dough. Give the kneaded dough a resting time of about 15 to 20 minutes.
                </p>
            <li><strong>Prepare the filling for samosa</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Blanch the peas for about 2 minutes while you microwave the potatoes. After the potatoes are microwaved, mash and peel them. 
                    Preheat some oil in a pan and saute chopped onions and all the spices. Then add blanched peas and mashed potatoes to it. 
                    Mix the whole mixture over a medium to high flame. After the mixture is incorporated, remove from heat and allow it to cool down
                </p>
            <li><strong>Deep fry the samosas</strong></li>
                <p>
                    In a heavy deep-bottomed pan, preheat the refined oil for deep frying. Now, pull a portion from the kneaded dough and roll it to form a 
                    smooth flat circle. With the help of a spoon, place the appropriate amount of the filling in the middle of the circle and envelope the 
                    filling with the dough in the desired shape. Seal all the sides and carefully drop them into hot oil to deep fry.

                <p>
                    Beat the hung curd with some sugar and red chilli powder. Transfer the fried samosas to a plate and break it into many pieces. 
                    Pour the hung curd over the samosas and add tamarind chutney onto it. Garnish with sev, coriander leaves, 
                    julienne carrot and beetroot and sprinkle the chaat masala and roasted cumin powder over it. You are all set to enjoy this delicious chaat recipe.
